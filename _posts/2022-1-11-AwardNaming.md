title: Award Naming
---

The Society of Systematic Biologists (SSB) posted
  a proposal to rename the "Ernst Mayr Award" to 
  the "Outstanding Student Presentation Award".
This proposal was approved by the SSB council and 
  explained at <a href="https://www.systbio.org/award-naming.html" target="_blank">https://www.systbio.org/award-naming.html</a>.

Predictably (but still regrettably), the conversation about this issue
	has turned very ugly on social media - often the targets have been
	early career researchers.
I've been an officer of the society since of 2020.
I voted in favor of sending the proposal to the SSB membership
  for a vote, and I expect to vote in favor of the renaming.
I thought the wording of the announcement at
  <a href="https://www.systbio.org/award-naming.html" target="_blank">mentioned above</a> was
  quite good, but it is easier to explain one's own position rather
  than craft a statement that expresses a consensus viewpoint.
So, I thought that I'd express my own viewpoint here. Sorry that this is not brief!

<h2>Who is the "target audience" of an award opportunity?</h2>
The people most affected by how a scientific
  society's award is "marketed" (ie. named and advertised) are
  the people who are eligible to compete for the award.
In the case of SSB's Ernst Mayr award, this is SSB members who are students or
  people who recently recieved their Ph.D.

While one would expect the applicants to be familiar with systematics,
  we should not assume much knowlege about the history 
  of SSB or a very detailed knowlege of all of the people who have contributed
  to systematics.
Systematics is one of the broadest discipline of biology; the winners of the award have had
  wide backgrounds not only from in biological 
   disciplines (from speciation theory to phylogenetics to biogeography...), but
   also from math and computer science.

Nor should we assume that the potential applicants are tightly connected to SSB already.
Many students join SSE, SSB, or ASN for the first time to get the discount on the
  cost of registering for the joint Evolution meeting.
It is quite plausible that they have not spoken to another SSB member or 
  interacted with SSB at all prior to the annual meeting.

We need to make our meetings and career opportunities as welcoming
  to new-comers as possible 
  (<a target="_blank" href="https://doi.org/10.1111/evo.14168">Rushworth <i>et al.</i>
  </a> provide a recent summary of how far the Evolution meetings are from
  being representative of society as a whole).
Presenting in a symposium to recognize the best student talks is very valuable
  for an early-career researcher.
So, SSB should strive to extend that invitation in a clear, welcoming manner
  to all scientists who are eligible.

If there was a way for SSB to have the award eligible population vote on this
	issue, I'd be happy to defer to that group, as they have the most at stake.
I don't know of a practical way to do that, so I think we (who are no longer
  eligible) need to listen to them as much as possible.

<h2>Is having an award named for a prominent scientist a potential barrier to participation?</h2>
If you had asked me this question a couple of years ago, I probably would have
  answered "only if the prominent scientist was infamous" (in evolutionary 
  biology, R. A. Fisher springs to mind).
However, after listening to many younger scientists (some on SSB council, but also some not
  members of SSB [as far as I know]) discuss the topic of the
  awards named after scienticists, I've changed my mind.
Some of the reasons expressed for preferring descriptive award names were
  things I might have thought of on my own, if I'd given the issue more thought: 
    there can be too much "hero-worship" in general in science, or the fact that a descriptive
	award title on a CV can speak to a broader audience (e.g. outside of academia).

But one of the comments that stuck with me was from an early-career scientist who
  remarked that they felt some hesitation when they encountered a named event/award/<i>etc</i>
  along the lines of "I should check more in depth to see if this is a person I want
  to be associated with" (I'm paraphrasing).
My instinct in that position would <i>not</i> have been to check or worry about it, because
	"some people are jerks, you can't let it hold you back" - but I haven't been
	discriminated against and nor has my family been discriminated against.
This had not sunk in for me: if you are a member of a group who has had to endure a long history
 of being made the target of hatred and discrimination, then a career opportunity named
    after someone (<i>even some one who, upon further research, turns out to be basically
    a good person</i>) involves some level of research and due diligence that would not
    be necessary of everyone.

As evolutionary biologists, we can't claim that such a concern is unnecessary - our
  field has done a very poor job of disavowing the more toxic aspects of our history.
It would be unrealistic to expect students to trust us to only name the awards and honors
  of our field after admirable people.


<h3>Is this a substantial barrier?</h3>
I don't know how many students might have been
  dissuaded by considerations such as this.
I don't know how much extra time/effort some students
  had to expend to allay their concerns about applying for the Mayr award.

But I also don't know of a reliable way to estimate how big of a problem this is.
If a student finds the award name off-putting, they may not join SSB and we'd probably
  never know.

This is nowhere close to being our field's most serious barrier to inclusivity.
If you take a look at the abusive commentary about this issue on blogs and Twitter
  you'll see an atmosphere that seems much more problematic.
I don't recall any one on SSB council expressing the opinion that this award naming
  issue was the most important thing we could do for DEI. But the current name does
strike me as a potential barrier, and I do think 
  that having a descriptive name is a better practice in general.


<h2>What are the downsides of having a descriptive name rather than the "Ernst Mayr Award in Systematic Biology"</h2>

<h3>Removing the name may lead to less recognition of the good work Mayr did (for science and SSB)</h3>
This sounds reasonable, but I just don't buy it.
I've been attending Evolution meetings since the 1990's, and
 don't recall much more than a cursory mention of Mayr in the symposium intro.
I think there was basically unanimity among the council that SSB should do a much
 better job at teaching members about the history of SSB and key figures in the history
 of systematics.
 
Past-president Laura Kubatko (who has been an outstanding SSB president during a very difficult
 2021) has organized an <a href="https://www.systbio.org/legacy-committe.html" target="_blank">SSB Legacy Committee</a> 
 to help rectify this.
That committee is made up of a stellar group of scientists, and I'm really looking
 forward to their contributions.
Regardless of how the vote turns out, I think this will be an unambiguous
 positive result of this whole issue.

<h3>Some students may prefer an award named after Mayr</h3>
Obviously we shouldn't expect everyone to feel the same about naming awards
  after people, and Mayr was much loved.
He had an truly outstanding level of productivity and many key contributions
  to evolutionary biology and systematics.
And he spoke out against racism, and was generous with his time and money toward
  the cause of helping young scientists.
I expect that anyone reading this has seen David Hillis' facebook post of 21 June, 2021 that
  was reposted on Panda's Thumb about Mayr. But if you haven't read it, you should read
  it is at the top of 
  <a href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2022/01/David-Hillis-on-Ernst-Mayr.html" target="_new">this post</a>
(I specify the top of that post, as I think some of David's other commentary on that page is
 unhelpful, but that is a different topic).
  
At least two graduate students made comments on that Panda's Thumb blog post 
  eloquently expressing their preference for retaining the name: see
  <a href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2022/01/David-Hillis-on-Ernst-Mayr.html#comment-5681790757" target="_blank">this comment by Mario Cupello</a>
  and <a href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2022/01/David-Hillis-on-Ernst-Mayr.html#comment-5681656191" target="_blank">this comment by Jackie Childers</a>
  (NB on that blog I often have to refresh the URL in the browser status bar to make it jump to a comment).
I really enjoyed reading their posts; it's very fun to see early-career researchers so excited about systematics.

It is clear to me that some SSB members will be very disappointed if we do change the name, and others
  will be equally disappointed if we don't.
It is hard to know what proportion of members fall into each group without voting
  on the proposal.
  
Polling is difficult. 
Counting social media posts "for" or "against" or looking at Twitter polls
 are not reliable methods. 
If I were an early researcher, I  wouldn't say anything about this issue given this climate.

I don't want to disappoint any early-career researcher who would prefer to
 compete for an award that was named after Mayr.
The deciding factor for me was: I do not see how
 the name "Outstanding Student Presentation Award in Systematic Biology" could
 be a barrier to anyone joining or participating in the competition.
So, the downside of the descriptive name seems lower to me.


  


<h2>What are the downsides to making a name change?</h2>
<h3>If people hear the name was changed without any explanation, they might think SSB was changing the name to criticize Mayr</h3>
It's a risk, but I don't think the council should avoid topics they 
 think might improve SSB just because people might get the wrong idea.
I think the best course is to just try to explain the motivation clearly.
This proposal is <i>explictly not</i> criticizing Mayr.
As stated in the announcement: 
  "This proposal is not intended to cast judgement on the legacy of Ernst Mayr, who was a prolific and profound scholar of evolutionary biology and a dedicated champion of students, nor are we intending to defend the contents of his writings which some find problematic."
Josef Uyeda had a  <a href="https://twitter.com/pseudacris/status/1479177881360207874">a nice thread</a> on this point.
	
<h3>There are probably more downsides I haven't thought of</h3>
I'll continue to read civil commentary on the issue to get more perspectives.
There is still time before a vote, so I'll try to keep listening.

<h2>Finally a conclusion to this post</h2>
I know this is too long, but hopefully it will be helpful to some.

Let's all be kind to each other and listen.
