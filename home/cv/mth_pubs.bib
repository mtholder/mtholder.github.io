	abstract = {
	The Open Tree of Life (OToL) project produces a supertree that summarizes phylogenetic knowledge from tree estimates published in the primary literature. The supertree construction algorithm iteratively calls Aho’s \textsc{Build} algorithm thousands of times in order to assess the compatability of different phylogenetic groupings. We describe an incrementalized version of the \textsc{Build} algorithm that is able to share work between successive calls to \textsc{Build}. We provide details that allow a programmer to implement the incremental algorithm \textsc{BuildInc}, including pseudo-code and a description of data structures. We assess the effect of \textsc{BuildInc} on our supertree algorithm by analyzing simulated data and by analyzing a supertree problem taken from the OpenTree 13.4 synthesis tree. We find that \textsc{BuildInc} provides up to 550-fold speedup for our supertree algorithm.

	We present a new supertree method that enables rapid estimation of a summary tree on the scale of millions of leaves. This supertree method summarizes a collection of input phylogenies and an input taxonomy. We introduce formal goals and criteria for such a supertree to satisfy in order to transparently and justifiably represent the input trees. In addition to producing a supertree, our method computes annotations that describe which grouping in the input trees support and conflict with each group in the supertree. We compare our supertree construction method to a previously published supertree construction method by assessing their performance on input trees used to construct the Open Tree of Life version 4, and find that our method increases the number of displayed input splits from 35,518 to 39,639 and decreases the number of conflicting input splits from 2,760 to 1,357. The new supertree method also improves on the previous supertree construction method in that it produces no unsupported branches and avoids unnecessary polytomies. This pipeline is currently used by the Open Tree of Life project to produce all of the versions of project’s “synthetic tree” starting at version 5. This software pipeline is called “\textit{propinquity}”. It relies heavily on “\textit{otcetera}”—a set of C++ tools to perform most of the steps of the pipeline. All of the components are free software and are available on GitHub.

Open Tree of Life provides web-service application programming interfaces (APIs) to make the tree estimate, unified taxonomy, and input phylogenetic data available to anyone. Here, we describe the Python package opentree, which provides a user friendly Python wrapper for these APIs and a set of scripts and tutorials for straightforward downstream data analyses. We demonstrate the utility of these tools by generating an estimate of the phylogenetic relationships of all bird families, and by capturing a phylogenetic estimate for all taxa observed at the University of California Merced Vernal Pools and Grassland Reserve.}",

	abstract = {The “multispecies” coalescent (MSC) model that underlies many genomic species-delimitation approaches is problematic because it does not distinguish between genetic structure associated with species versus that of populations within species. Consequently, as both the genomic and spatial resolution of data increases, a proliferation of artifactual species results as within-species population lineages, detected due to restrictions in gene flow, are identified as distinct species. The toll of this extends beyond systematic studies, getting magnified across the many disciplines that rely upon an accurate framework of identified species. Here we present the first of a new class of approaches that addresses this issue by incorporating an extended speciation process for species delimitation. We model the formation of population lineages and their subsequent development into independent species as separate processes and provide for a way to incorporate current understanding of the species boundaries in the system through specification of species identities of a subset of population lineages. As a result, species boundaries and within-species lineages boundaries can be discriminated across the entire system, and species identities can be assigned to the remaining lineages of unknown affinities with quantified probabilities. In addition to the identification of species units in nature, the primary goal of species delimitation, the incorporation of a speciation model also allows us insights into the links between population and species-level processes. By explicitly accounting for restrictions in gene flow not only between, but also within, species, we also address the limits of genetic data for delimiting species. Specifically, while genetic data alone is not sufficient for accurate delimitation, when considered in conjunction with other information we are able to not only learn about species boundaries, but also about the tempo of the speciation process itself.},
