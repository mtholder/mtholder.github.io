<h3>The ad on evoldir for open tree position</h3>
A position for a postdoctoral researcher is available in the laboratory of
Dr. Mark Holder in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the
University of Kansas (Lawrence, KS).  The duration of the position is two
years. The research projects that fund the position focus on developing improved
methods of conducting multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic inference. In
particular, designing new algorithms and statistical models for updating large
gene trees in light of new sequence data is an important target for the work.
The postdoctoral researcher will be expected to contribute to the software
efforts of a multi-institutional collaborative effort to integrate phylogenetic
estimates across the entire tree of life ( <a href="http://opentreeoflife.org" title="http://opentreeoflife.org">http://opentreeoflife.org</a> ).
Candidates will be expected to have completed a PhD in Biology, Statistics,
Computer Science or a related field.  Preferably the candidate will have
experience in Python and either Java, C, or C++.  

The ideal candidate will be enthusiastic, motivated, have a strong background in
phylogenetics, and have experience implementing statistical inference techniques
in software as demonstrated by materials submitted through the application
process, work experience, and letters of reference, and/or previous
publications.

<!--h3>Ad for part-time position on the project for improving phylogenetic methods for fossil taxa</h3>
A position for a part-time postdoctoral researcher is available in the laboratory of Dr. Mark Holder in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Kansas (Lawrence, KS). The funding for the position allow for part-time (approximately 40% time) work for up to 3 years. The research project that funds the position focuses on developing novel methods for estimating phylogenetic relationships and dates associated with these phylogenies using data from fossil taxa. The postdoctoral researcher will be expected to devise statistical models for these processes, implement these models in open-source software, and validate the performance of the methods through a combination of simulation tests and analysis of real data.  The work will also include the development of new methods for analysing rates of diversification.

The ideal candidate will be enthusiastic, motivated, have a strong background in phylogenetics, and have experience implementing Bayesian phylogenetic techniques in C++ as demonstrated by materials submitted through the application process, work experience, and/or previous publications. Demonstrated expertise in estimating divergence times is also an important qualification for the work. Application deadline 04/12/13.
